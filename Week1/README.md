# Week 1 — Python Foundation & Git Basics

## What I Learned

### 🔹 Core Concepts
- Difference between AI, ML, DL, and Data Science  
- Python basics (variables, loops, conditions, functions)  
- Writing simple programs using input/output  
- Git basics (init, add, commit, push)  
- How to organize a professional GitHub project  

### 🔹 Modular Python & Data Handling
- Creating reusable functions using *args and **kwargs  
- Lambda (anonymous) functions  
- Working with Python modules and imports  
- File handling (read, write, append)  
- Exception handling using try / except / else / finally  
- Using built-in data structures (lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries)  
- List & dictionary comprehensions  
- Writing programs that safely handle real-world errors  

### 🔹 Object-Oriented & Advanced Python
- Understanding Classes & Objects  
- Encapsulation using protected variables  
- Inheritance and method overriding  
- Polymorphism in real examples  
- Magic methods like `__init__` and `__str__`  
- Creating and using decorators  
- Generators using `yield`  
- Thinking in terms of objects instead of scripts
