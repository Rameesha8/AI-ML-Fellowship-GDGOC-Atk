# AI vs ML vs DL vs Data Science — Summary

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the broad field focused on creating systems that can mimic human intelligence.  
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that allows systems to learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed.  
Deep Learning (DL) is a specialized branch of ML that uses neural networks with many layers to solve complex problems like image and speech recognition.  
Data Science is a broader field that involves data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization to extract insights.  
AI is the goal, ML and DL are techniques to achieve it, while Data Science focuses on understanding and working with data.  
All these fields overlap and work together in modern intelligent systems.
